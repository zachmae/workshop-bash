# workshop functional tests in bash scripts

## Task 1: Number of arguments
create a script that display the number of arguments given when you call the script

## Task 2: Arguments list
create a script that display the arguments as a list given when you call the script

## Task 3: is there an argument ?
create a script that display "no argument" if you don't give any argument when you call the script and "argument" if you give an argument

### (Bonus): is this argument a number ?
if you want to push this task forward, you can try to check if the given argument is a number or not

## Task 4: Let's start with loops ?
create a script that display every number from 1 to 10 using a loop

### (Bonus): Let's iterate over a list
if you want to push this task forward, you can try to iterate over a list of arguments by displaying each argument on a new line

## Task 5: So now we can create a function ?
try to create a function that display hello world in your script

## Task 6: Let's test our program ?*
### part 0
you see the do_op.zip file in this repository, you can unzip it
it's a program that can do some basic operations on numbers in C
you can compile it with the given Makefile
### part 1
create a function that can execute the do_op program with the given arguments
### part 2
create a function that can compare the return value of the do_op program with the expected value given as argument
### part 3
create a function that can compare the displayed text of the do_op program with the content of a file given as argument
### Bonus ideas
- Colors ?
- *layout ?*
- **layout 2 ?**
- <ins>layout 3 ?</ins>
